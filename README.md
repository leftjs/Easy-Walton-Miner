# Easy-Walton-Miner
Application for running the Walton CPU and GPU miner through the command prompt. Allows the user to bypass the thread limit, reach 100% CPU usage on high power machines, and easily configure its options in order to automatically start mining the way you like in one click.

**The most recent release can always be downloaded from the Releases page.**

## Using Extra Data
If you want to include extra data in the blocks you mine so that you can track your rigs, we reccommend using the LITE versions of the miner. All you need to do is edit the start_automated batch file in notepad and replace "--extradata "easyMiner"" with whatever unique phrase you want to use. Then you can head on [over here](http://easyWaltonTracker.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com) to view the data.

## Installation ("Full" Version)
This is the version you want if you want a lot of customization options, logging features, and other future improvements. Runs in Python which may or may not have an impact on performance depending on your machine. **If you experience a low hash rate with this version, try the Lite version.**
1) Extract the ```easyWaltonMiner-Fullv1.6.1.zip``` file wherever you would like.
2) Right click on ```easyWaltonMiner.exe``` and click Send to -> Desktop (create shortcut) in order to create a Desktop shortcut for convenience.
2) Click your new shortcut and copy/past in your WTC Wallet address.
3) You should now be mining!

## Installation ("GPU" Version)
Right now, our GPU miner runs in a shell script, similar to the Lite version. Maybe there will be a "Full" version in the future, but for now, this is the one you want if you wish to use your GPU for mining.
1) Extract the ```GPU-easyWaltonMiner-Litev1.6.1.zip``` file anywhere you'd like (we recommend the WTC wallet directory.)
2) Right click on ```easy-miner-GPU.bat``` and click Send to -> Desktop (create shortcut) in order to create a Desktop shortcut for convenience.
2) Click your new shortcut and copy/past in your WTC Wallet address.
3) You should now be mining!

## Installation ("Lite" Version)
If you are worried about performance, or don't trust an executable file, you can download the lite version. It is entirely containted in two batch files, but it is very simplistic and will only recieve minor bug fixes going forward.
1) Extract the ```easyWaltonMiner-Litev1.6.1.zip``` file anywhere you'd like (we recommend the WTC wallet directory.)
2) Right click on ```easy-miner.bat``` and click Send to -> Desktop (create shortcut) in order to create a Desktop shortcut for convenience.
2) Click your new shortcut and copy/paste in your WTC Wallet address. 
3) You now should be mining!

## Configuration ("Full" Version Only)
There are a few command line configuration options available. The easiest way to use them is to create a shortcut as explained above. Then you can right click your EasyWaltonMiner shorcut, click "Properties," and edit the "Target" so that the flags are placed at the end of the command, before the close quote. Example:

```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\EasyWaltonMiner\easyWaltonMiner.exe -t 16 -nolog -pkp address.txt"
```

Available options:
```
-wp or --walletpath [path] : Path to the WTC Walton Wallet folder. Defaults to C:/Program Files/WTC
-pkp or --publickeypath [path] : Path to public key text file. Defaults to pubaddr.txt
-m or --mode [mode] : Mode to launch in. Valid values are address, mine, and config.
-nl or --nolog : Disables miner logging. Logging is on by default and logs to EasyWaltonMiner/logfile.txt
-nhl or --nohashlog : Disables hashrate logging. Logging is on by default and logs to EasyWaltonMiner/hashlog.csv
-t or --threads [value] : Number of threads to use. Defaults to max threads. 
```

Alternatively, using the above method but adding the ```-m config``` flag will load an experimental config menu on launch which can also configure the above options.

## Building from Source
For the lite and GPU versions, simply copy the ```easy-miner.bat```/```easy-miner-GPU.bat``` and ```start_automated.bat```/```start_automated_GPU.bat``` to the WTC directory.

For the full version, either run ```build.bat```, or run ```pyinstaller easyWaltonMiner.py``` (both require python and pyinstaller.) Output will be generated in dist/ folder.

## Troubleshooting
```The lite or GPU miners close instantly.``` If you have installed the wallet to a directory other than ```C:/Program Files/WTC```, you must edit the ```start_automated.bat``` or ```start_automated_GPU.bat``` to reflect your wallet install path.


```Error loading Python DLL 'C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\easyWaltonMiner\python36.dll'. LoadLibrary: The specified module could not be found.``` Check that you have made a shortcut to the application and not accidentally copied the .exe to your Desktop instead. Also, if you downloaded the v1.5 release, that release was not packaged with the correct binaries. Download the most recent release and try again.

```No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.``` Check to see if all instances of the Walton wallet are closed. Additionally, if you have installed the wallet to a directory other than ```C:/Program Files/WTC```, you must edit the ```start_automated_GPU.bat``` to reflect your wallet install path.

Donations are **not** required, but we did work really hard on this! Walton's new token should not at this time be transferred due to the upcoming coin swap, so for now we have listed an Ethereum wallet if you are feeling so kind as to send us a donation. Thank you for your support!
